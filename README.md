# FrackMented
Tiled, dynamic interface for analyzing news &amp; its "metadata" - in this case, video maps, timelines, and highlights of hydraulic fracturing in the U.S.

To run locally:

* clone repo
* install node & npm
* run `npm install http-server -g` 
* run `http-server` from project root

Project is now available at localhost:8080

*Note: any basic http server should work as well as the above npm package, since the project is a static site that performs simple Ajax load requests*
