Tiled, dynamic interface for analyzing news & its "metadata" - in this case, video maps, timelines, and highlights of hydraulic fracturing in the U.S. Completed during sophomore year to investigate new methods of displaying politically relevant information. Winner of the [Interdisciplinary Award](https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/1734/symposium-superstars/) at USC's Undergrad Research Symposium.
