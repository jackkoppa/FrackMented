New state-wide fracking regulations for California; more oversight soon required. Environmentalists claim it's not enough.
</div>


<div id="story">  
   <p>California on Friday unveiled draft rules to police unconventional oil drilling, a highly anticipated development that followed a multiyear debate on whether new restrictions were needed.</p>


	<p>Companies using oil recovery techniques that include hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking," under the proposal must obtain permits from the state, give at least 72 hours' notice and identify where the work will occur.</p>


	<p>They would also need to reveal how much water would be used and the source of that fluid. Testing of the groundwater quality in most cases must happen in advance. There are rules on reporting earthquakes near drilling and chemicals used in fracking formulas.</p>


	<p>But those preliminary <a href="http://www.conservation.ca.gov/index/Documents/Text%20of%20Proposed%20Regulations%20-%20SB%204%20Well%20Stimulation%20Treatment%20Regulations.pdf">guidelines</a> did little to satisfy some environmentalists who have opposed fracking.</p>


	<p>Within hours of the release, some green groups renewed calls for a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, where companies blast chemical-laced water some 8,000 feet underground at high pressure to break apart rock formations and release oil or natural gas. Environmental organizations began conferring on how to renew their push for a ban when the Golden State's Legislature returns to lawmaking in January.</p>


	<p>"The only safe way forward for California is a halt to fracking," said Kassie Siegel, senior counsel at the Center for Biological Diversity. "These regulations are very industry-friendly. But even the best regulations wouldn't change the fact that we have to leave this unconventional shale oil in the ground."</p>


	<p>An oil trade group based in Kern County, Calif., the region that leads the state in fracking activity, scorned the idea that increased production is a negative.</p>


	<p>"That's crazy," said Les Clark, executive vice president of the Independent Oil Producers' Agency (IOPA). "These people were already set to oppose anything we do.</p>


	<p>"Their minds are already made up," Clark added. "I would be willing to bet that most of these environmental-type people haven't even read the regulation."</p>


	<p>The California Department of Conservation's Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) released the preliminary rules in response to legislation, <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_4_bill_20130920_chaptered.htm">S.B. 4</a>, which state Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed into law last month. The draft launched a 60-day comment period after which the agency will release final rules. Those would take effect Jan. 1, 2015.</p>


	<p>It's the latest chapter in California's debate over how much to govern fracking. DOGGR in December 2012 released a discussion draft of potential regulations. Environmentalists and some community activists decried those as inadequate. S.B. 4 identified specifics that DOGGR was required to follow. But that law before it passed divided green groups with several opposing the measure (<a href="http://www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1059987122/"><em>EnergyWire</em></a>, Sept. 12).</p>


	<p>Sierra Club California and the Center for Biological Diversity, among others, insist that fracking can't coexist with the state's push to cut greenhouse gas emissions and otherwise help limit climate change.</p>


	<p>California has the most ambitious climate goals in the nation. By 2020, it wants to shrink climate pollution to 1990 levels and to cut it 80 percent below the 1990 point by 2050.</p>


	<p>Brown is "a big believer in climate change. He's made that one of his signature issues," said Ethan Elkind, a climate research fellow at the University of California, Berkeley's School of Law. The governor has pushed for laws that boost development of renewable power and electric vehicles.</p>


	<p>That creates a tension on the fracking issue in Brown's office, Elkind said. But it could be tough for environmental groups to secure a fracking moratorium.</p>


	<p>"The governor's made it clear that he's not out there to stop fracking. If anything, I get the sense he sees a lot of potential there for California economically," Elkind said. "There's too much sort of political pressure to let fracking go forward just because there's just a much money to be made. That's the bottom line."</p>


<h3>Monterey Shale stokes fears, hopes</h3>

	<p>Previous pushes for a moratorium have failed. S.B. 4, from Sen. Fran Pavley (D), was the sole surviving measure of several that sought to restrict hydraulic fracturing.</p>


	<p>At one point, there were 10 bills, including three that sought a ban. Two of those were killed in committee. The third, A.B. 1323 from Assemblywoman Holly Mitchell of Los Angeles, died in the Assembly on a 24-37 vote. (Another 20 lawmakers did not vote on it.)</p>


	<p>The fracking issue in the state is made more complicated by the existence of the Monterey Shale. That swath of land stretches from the middle of California south to Los Angeles County. Geologists believe it holds 15.5 billion barrels of recoverable petroleum, two-thirds of the shale oil reserves in the United States. Oil and natural gas companies are working to unlock the fuel.</p>


	<p>If that oil were burned, Siegel said, it would create 6 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. By comparison, she said, it's estimated that U.S. EPA's new rules for passenger vehicles mileage for model years 2017 to 2025 will prevent 2 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>


	<p>"Two billion tons, that is a flagship measure celebrated as a great step forward," Siegel said. "Developing the Monterey Shale would undo that three times over."</p>


	<p>At the same time, a report from the University of Southern California Price School of Public Policy and USC Viterbi School of Engineering said that development of the Monterey Shale could bring the state $4.5 billion to $24.6 billion in tax revenues. It could increase California's overall economic activity by 2.6 to 14.3 percent on a per-person basis, the analysis said.</p>


	<p>"We're just sitting on a potential huge amount of wealth that's just under our feet," Elkind said. "It's a hard thing to say, 'No, we're not going to tap into all that money,' particularly at a time when the state's fiscal state is so dire."</p>


	<p>Brown's office did not immediately respond to questions about fracking and climate and the push for a moratorium. Earlier this year, when asked about where he stood on hydraulic fracturing, Brown said that "it's about looking at what could be a fabulous opportunity."</p>


	<p>"The reason I have sympathy for oil drilling in California is because 98 percent of people are using oil that's imported," Brown said in May. "Until we get them in electric cars, or walking, or riding their bikes, we need oil" (<a href="http://www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1059981194/"><em>EnergyWire</em></a>, May 15).</p>


	<p>Clark, with IOPA, said that it will be impossible to satisfy environmental groups with regulations because they oppose oil use.</p>


	<p>"There's no compromise with them. Come on," Clark said.</p>


	<p>Kathryn Phillips, executive director of Sierra Club California, said that there's a difference between using oil from conventional drilling and that from new techniques. Calculations on reducing greenhouse gas emissions factor in "known and extractable" sources of carbon. Fracking adds what were previously unextractable sources, she said.</p>


	<p>"Nobody's had a chance to have a really robust debate about, if the state is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that the effects of climate change are less disruptive than they might otherwise be, then we need to keep these so-called new carbons on the ground," Phillips said.</p>


	<p>"We recognize that there is, at least in the near term, going to be some oil drilled for lots of different things," she added, "but we think the state and the nation and the world needs to be weaned away from carbon fuels."</p>


<h3>Draft regulations will be analyzed</h3>

	<p>Groups for and against fracking and other unconventional drilling said that they still need to fully analyze the draft regulations before deciding the next steps.</p>


	<p>Under the preliminary rules, drilling companies must disclose the chemical makeup of the fracking fluid, including total dissolved solids, radioactive chemicals and other organic or inorganic chemicals. The rules allow them in some cases to say the information is a trade secret and have the state shield the data from the public. If a well fails, companies would be forced to reveal the information more fully.</p>


	<p>Pavley's office noted that under S.B. 4, the only information "that can be potentially withheld as a trade secret is the quantity of individual chemical ingredients within an additive, and even that must still be disclosed to regulators, doctors and health researchers."</p>


	<p>The state's Water Resources Control Board separately is developing a groundwater monitoring system to be deployed in oil fields. An expert panel will produce criteria over the next year to characterize water quality near the fields, officials said.</p>


	<p>"One of the big changes of S.B. 4 and one of the things that you will see in the regulations ... is this new requirement for groundwater monitoring. This is not something that has been previously in existence," said Jason Marshall, deputy director of California's Department of Conservation.</p>


	<p>"It's important to note that our existing baseline knowledge of groundwater quality is somewhat limited," he added. "One of the successes of S.B. 4, the big improvements in environmental protection in California, is that it's going to increase our base-line understanding of groundwater."</p>


	<p>Phillips said fracking poses a threat to water, one the regulations don't sufficiently abate.</p>


	<p>"It will sap -- because of the way fracking uses huge volumes of water and has a huge amount of mud waste associated with -- it will drain water supplies," Phillips said.</p>


	<p>The draft regulations also have a provision on earthquakes. The rules require companies within 60 days after completing drilling to file a report with DOGGR describing the results of the well stimulation treatment. In addition, they have to report any earthquake of magnitude 2.0 or greater in the area of the activity.</p>
