New Yorkers Oppose Fracking, use Gas

While New York localities continue to oppose fracking, New Yorkers happily use 'clean' natural gas from nearby Pennsylvania.

<div id="story">  
  <p>The state of New York effectively has a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing as the government figures out how to regulate the controversial drilling technology. Still, the state is benefiting from a fracking-fueled drilling boom in next-door Pennsylvania.</p>   <p>For decades, oil has been the fuel of choice for thousands of residential buildings in New York City. But now there are fewer chimneys spewing black smoke. That's because the city <a href="http://www.nyccleanheat.org/" target="_blank">has a program</a> encouraging owners to convert to cleaner-burning natural gas.</p>   <p>The switch is happening all over the city, including in a 100-unit building on the Upper East Side that Burt Wallack's company manages. The owners are spending nearly $300,000 to make the switch.</p>   <p>"In this particular building, it was a no-brainer — the payback will be in about three years," Wallack says. "The day we switch over, we'll start saving approximately 50 percent of our energy costs."</p>   <p>For now, the building is still burning oil because utility Con Edison is upgrading the city's natural gas distribution system. The system originally was intended for things like cooking. But now bigger pipes and updated equipment are needed so natural gas can be used for heating and hot water, too.</p>   <p>"This year alone we're going to have converted more than 1,100 very large buildings in New York City," says Christine Cummings, a section manager in the utility's gas conversion group.</p>   <p>Recently another company, Spectra Energy, put in service <a href="http://www.spectraenergy.com/Newsroom/News-Archive/Spectra-Energy-Places-New-JerseyNew-York-Natural-Gas-Pipelie-into-Service/" target="_blank">a large pipeline expansion</a> that's bringing a lot more gas into Manhattan. That increased supply already is pushing down prices in the region.</p>   <p>"If we compare this November to last November, we actually see gas prices decrease about 13 percent," says Anne Swedberg, senior energy analyst with the firm Bentek Energy.</p>
