16 earthquakes in the past 3 weeks worry residents, who fear fracking may be to blame.
</div>


<div id="story">  
   <p>Northern Texas towns are experiencing an intense string of earthquakes – the last of which was one of the most powerful in 5 years. As unusual tremors have been going on for over 3 weeks now, many suspect fracking might be to blame.</p>
                
<p>
  On Thursday, the region experienced two tremors, with one of them
  registering 3.6 magnitude, 55 km west of the town of Azle at
  07:58:36 GMT, as recorded by the US Geological Service, and the
  other 2.8 at 08:41:07 GMT, with the epicenter not far from the
  first one. USGS records show that the 3.6 tremor was one of the
  strongest earthquakes to hit the region in 5 years.
</p><p>
  <i>“It sounded like a sonic boom, and then the house started
  shaking,”</i> Keith Krayer, a local resident who felt the effects
  of the quake, told RT.
</p><p>
  Krayer said he had no doubt the quake was sparked by
  fracking. <i style="line-height: 1.45em;">“When they frack,
  they inject all that water and chemicals into the ground, then
  they pump it back up and separate the gas from the water, then
  they have to dispose of that water 13,000 feet down. It causes
  the plates to slip, the lubrication from the water.”</i>
</p><p>
  Residents like Krayer are having their nerves put to the test as
  the region chalked up its <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/#%7B%22feed%22%3A%2230day_m25%22%2C%22search%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A%221385635448083%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22Search%20Results%22%2C%22isSearch%22%3Atrue%2C%22params%22%3A%7B%22starttime%22%3A%222013-11-21%2000%3A00%3A00%22%2C%22minmagnitude%22%3A6%2C%22endtime%22%3A%222013-11-28%2023%3A59%3A59%22%2C%22orderby%22%3A%22time%22%7D%7D%2C%22sort%22%3A%22newest%22%2C%22basemap%22%3A%22terrain%22%2C%22autoUpdate%22%3Afalse%2C%22restrictListToMap%22%3Atrue%2C%22timeZone%22%3A%22local%22%2C%22mapposition%22%3A%5B%5B32.21163915464707%2C-98.44573974609375%5D%2C%5B33.43831750748322%2C-96.68792724609375%5D%5D%2C%22overlays%22%3A%7B%22plates%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22viewModes%22%3A%7B%22map%22%3Atrue%2C%22list%22%3Atrue%2C%22settings%22%3Atrue%2C%22help%22%3Afalse%7D%7D" target="_blank">16th this month</a>. In the last four days, there
  have been six recorded quakes.
</p><p>
  <span style="line-height: 1.45em;">Between 1970
  and </span><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">2007, the area
  around the Texas town of Azle (pop. 10,000) experienced just two
  earthquakes. The peace and quiet began to change, however, at the
  start of 2008, when 74 minor quakes were reported in the
  region.</span>
  <br></p><p>
  Now an increasing number of people, including scientists, are
  speculating that natural gas production by fracking - a process
  that forces high pressure water and chemicals into rock in order
  to extract natural gas reserves - is the culprit. The problem,
  however, is proving the claims.
</p><p>
  <span style="line-height: 1.45em;">Cliff Frolich, earthquake
  researcher at the University of Texas, said waste water injection
  wells from fracking could be responsible for the recent spate of
  earthquake activity.</span>
</p><p>
  <i>"I'd say it certainly looks very possible that the earthquakes
  are related to injection wells,"</i> he said in an interview with
  KHOU television.
</p><p>
  Frolich left room for doubt when he said thousands of such wells
  have operated in Texas for decades with no quakes anywhere near
  them.
</p><p>
  Frolich co-authored a 2009 study on earthquake activity near
  Cleburne, just south of Azle, which concluded: "The possibility
  exists that earthquakes may be related to fluid injection."
  <br>
  A recent government study lent credence to Frolich’s findings.
</p><p>
  The use of underground storage wells to get rid of waste water
  produced by fracking is “almost certainly” to blame for the jump
  in earthquakes in Midwestern states in recent years, a recent
  Geological Survey study has found.
</p><p>
  The report said the number of magnitude-3 earthquakes or greater
  occurring in the mid-region of North America surged from 29 in
  2008 to 134 last year.
</p><p>
  The <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/man-made-earthquakes/" target="_blank">USGS</a> study pointed to an unusual surge in
  tremors near wastewater wells in many US states, including
  Arkansas, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and Ohio<span style="line-height: 1.45em;">. </span>
</p><p>
  
  <span style="line-height: 1.45em;">However, the USGS stopped
  short of linking the process of fracking to earthquakes directly,
  mostly blaming methods used to dispose of fracking
  by-products.</span>
</p><p>
  In January 2012, following a rash of earthquakes, including a
  4.0-magnitude tremor, Ohio legislators placed a temporary ban on
  fracking after experts said the controversial process for storing
  waste water in deep underground wells was to blame for the
  outbreak of tremors.
</p><p>
  Meanwhile, the mayor of Azle, Alan Brundrett, said it's crucial
  to determine whether the latest series of quakes are man-made.
</p><p>
  <i>"What could it cause down the road?"</i> he
  asked. <i>"What if a 5.0 happens and people's houses start
  falling in on them?" 
  <br>
  "Enough is enough!</i>" Keith Krayer, a resident of Briar, just
  north of Azle was quoted by the station as saying. <i>"My
  wife, she's having panic attacks because of it."</i>
</p><p>
  Thus far, the rattling has just produced a lot of anxiety. The
  Parker County Sheriff's Office has no reports of damage or
  injuries from any of Thursday’s earthquakes.
</p><p>
  As of March 2012, Texas had listed nearly 6,000 oil and gas
  fracking wells on FracFocus, an industry fracking disclosure
  site, SourceWatch.org reports.
</p><p>
  The first instance of hydraulic fracturing – creating fractures
  from a wellbore drilled into reservoir rock formations – was
  reportedly performed in 1947, the organization notes. Fracking on
  a commercial scale, however, was first used in the Barnett Shale
  – a geological formation which underlies the city of Fort Worth
  and at least 17 counties.
</p><p>
  The first Barnett Shale well was completed in 1981 in Wise
  County, Texas. Subsequent drilling expanded greatly in the early
  2000s due to a hike in natural gas prices and the use of
  horizontal wells to increase production.
  <br></p><p>
  Fracking and horizontal drilling technology have been heralded as
  an economic boon by the oil industry, though the techniques have
  contributed to nationwide concern about air pollution,
  groundwater contamination and broader environmental
  degradation.
