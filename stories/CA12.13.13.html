SAN FRANCISCO — California drillers eager to use hydraulic fracturing to tap the nation’s largest <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/oil-petroleum-and-gasoline/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about oil." class="meta-classifier">oil</a> shale formation will face comprehensive regulation for the first time next year under rules issued this week.        </p>      <p itemprop="articleBody">
The rules take effect on Jan. 1, though they will be replaced a year later by permanent regulations that are still being developed but are expected to be similar. In September, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/docs/SB_4_Signing_Message.pdf">law</a> that established the outlines for the regulations.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The new rules require drillers to <a href="http://www.conservation.ca.gov/dog/for_operators/Documents/NTO 11-20-13 Form Inst.pdf">alert neighboring landowners </a>at least 30 days before using hydraulic fracturing techniques, known as fracking, and to test their water wells upon request. The drillers must do other groundwater monitoring and also disclose many of the chemicals used. The rules cover the use of acids, which are sometimes used to dissolve rock to access oil.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The rules cover many phases of the drilling process, analysts say, though they fall short of what many environmental groups want.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
“There’s definitely a tension in California between environmental groups who would like to see the practice halt, at least until there’s a lot more research, and folks who would like to see it continue basically unregulated,” said Emily Murray, a Los Angeles-based partner at the law firm Allen Matkins, whose clients hold a range of views on fracking.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
California’s approach to fracking, she added, is “certainly short of banning the practice, but it’s a pretty thorough look.”        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The regulations are being imposed at a time when many states are moving to tighten restrictions on fracking, which is the extraction of oil or <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/natural-gas/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about natural gas." class="meta-classifier">natural gas</a> out of underground rocks by the use of a high-pressure mix of water, sand and chemicals.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
California is already the nation’s <a href="http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_crd_crpdn_adc_mbbl_m.htm">third-largest oil producing state</a>, but production has recently been flat, unlike surging North Dakota and Texas.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
A formation known as the Monterey Shale that lies beneath Bakersfield and other central and southern California areas is believed to hold <a href="http://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/usshalegas/">about two-thirds of the nation’s recoverable shale oil</a>, according to an estimate by the federal Energy Information Administration.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Drillers are eager to tap the oil in the shale, but environmentalists fear that water and air pollution could result, and they are also concerned about the possibility of earthquakes linked to the disposal of fracking fluids.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Even though fracking has been taking place in California for decades, it has been stymied by the uneven and complex geology of the Monterey Shale. Some say the geological challenges could even thwart major long-term development.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
California frackers are already subject to standard rules for drillers, like a <a href="http://www.conservation.ca.gov/dog/general_information/Documents/121712NarrativeforHFregs.pdf">mandatory review of the design of oil and gas wells</a>. But the rise of fracking, with its special liquid chemical blend, has prompted calls for extra oversight. The rules governing the design of wells, for example, will be enhanced with new testing requirements.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, said that California’s new rules were more comprehensive than any other state’s. “I think it covers every possible area that one could think of,” she said. The industry accepts the new regulations, she added.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The permanent rules will include more specific groundwater monitoring requirements, and also make it easier for the state to say no to drillers if their paperwork is inadequate.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Over all, however, “There won’t be a huge change between what they’re doing between 2014 and 2015,” said Jason Marshall, the chief deputy director of California’s Department of Conservation, which oversees the state’s oil and gas regulatory division. The public will have a chance to attend hearings and comment.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The rules do not go as far as the state’s environmental lobbyists would like. On Thursday, more than 100 environmental groups sent a <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/offshore_fracking/pdfs/NGO_letter_to_CCC_offshore_fracking.pdf">letter</a> to California coastal regulators urging a stop to offshore fracking. With fracking, “the risks of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/o/oil_spills/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about oil spills." class="meta-classifier">oil spills</a>, vessel traffic, discharges of toxic waste, and air pollution are substantially increased,” the groups wrote.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
On Dec. 19, a court in California is scheduled to hear a case brought against state regulators by several environmental groups that want fracking to go through an environmental review process before it is allowed to continue. California plans to complete two major studies by July 2015.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Essentially, “They’re greenlighting fracking for the next year,” said Will Rostov, a staff lawyer for Earthjustice in California, which represents the environmental groups in the case. He added, “They’re not doing the environmental analysis that needs to be done.”        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
He said New York had a better approach. Fracking in the natural gas-rich Marcellus Shale is being delayed in New York until the state completes a health and environmental review. “You need to study it before you allow it,” Mr. Rostov said.        </p>
