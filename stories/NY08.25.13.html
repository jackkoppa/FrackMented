Governor Cuomo's caution on making a decision regarding fracking highlighted by its prevalence to the south.

  <p>New York Gov. 
            <a href="http://topics.wsj.com/person/C/Andrew-Cuomo/5961">Andrew Cuomo</a>,

       facing a politically fraught decision on whether to allow fracking in New York state, has dispatched top administration officials from coast to coast in the past year in search of advice and information on its health and environmental impacts.</p> <p>His deliberative approach on hydraulic fracturing, even as neighboring Pennsylvania and other states have quickly adopted such drilling for natural gas, has drawn praise from environmentalists and some communities that oppose fracking. But it has frustrated many upstate New York residents and local officials, who have embraced fracking as a source of energy-industry jobs in a region suffering from population and employment losses.</p> <p>That discord was on display Friday in economically struggling Binghamton, N.Y., where an appearance by President 

            <a href="http://topics.wsj.com/person/O/Barack-Obama/4328">Barack Obama</a>

       sparked renewed pressure on his fellow Democrat to address the matter, particularly in light of Mr. Obama's June remarks praising &quot;cleaner-burning natural gas.&quot;</p>
        <p>Fracking opponents and backers, including local landowners, flooded the area surrounding Binghamton University, where Mr. Obama spoke, hoping to influence Mr. Cuomo's decision on a matter that has been under review by state regulators since before he assumed office in 2011. It isn't clear when Mr. Cuomo will make a decision.</p> <p>Fracking poses an uncomfortable political issue for Mr. Cuomo as he heads into his re-election campaign in 2014, and as his name continues to be floated as a 2016 presidential candidate, with voters statewide split over a practice that is growing nationwide.</p> <p>Mr. Cuomo didn't attend Mr. Obama's speech in Binghamton, but earlier in the week he nodded toward the president's position on natural gas. At the same time, he said he wanted to further examine the environmental impact of fracking, which the energy industry says has been proven safe and which environmentalists call a threat to drinking water.</p> <p>&quot;It has obvious economic benefits. Every area that has participated in fracking will tell you that it has increased commercial activity and it has an economic-boost effect,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said in a radio interview.</p> <p>&quot;The question is, is there a cost to the environment, to health, etc.? And that's what has to be assessed, and that's what has to be weighed,&quot; Mr. Cuomo said, adding, &quot;But the president's point—that fracking has economic benefits, energy benefits for this country—that's inarguable.&quot;</p> <p>New York state Sen. Tom Libous, a Binghamton Republican and staunch fracking backer, said last week, &quot;I'm not a fan of President Obama. I'm not a fan of Obamacare. I'm not a fan of a lot of things that he stands for. However, he supports environmentally safe drilling, and so do I.&quot;</p> <p>&quot;Hopefully, people who listen to him on other issues will listen to him on this issue,&quot; Mr. Libous added. &quot;And hopefully, Gov. Cuomo will listen, too.&quot;</p> <p>Mr. Cuomo's administration has repeatedly delayed ruling on whether to allowing drilling in Binghamton and elsewhere in the state's Southern Tier, which sits atop the Marcellus Shale rock formation and is across the border from Pennsylvania's fracking boom. The governor's administration says more time is needed for the Department of Health to complete a review.</p> <p>In recent months, state health Commissioner Nirav Shah and department representatives have traveled the country seeking input from health experts who have studied the practice. In October, the state sent health and environmental-conservation department representatives to Canada, where they sat down with Quebec officials to discuss drilling in the province.</p> <p>In January, Dr. Shah visited drill and water-acquisition sites in Pennsylvania. In March, he met with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency representatives in Washington, D.C., to discuss the agency's study of the effect of shale gas on water resources. And in July and August, he conducted site visits and met with researchers and state regulators in California, Texas and Illinois.</p> <p>In Binghamton, those exploratory efforts do little to appease such landowners as Neil Vitale, 65 years old, who gathered with about 150 others on Friday to advocate for fracking on his 500-acre organic dairy farm in Woodhull.</p> <p>&quot;It's the only thing that is going to help small family farms survive in upstate New York,&quot; he said. &quot;We're under the gun, because we're paying the highest property taxes on agricultural land of any farmers in the country. And this activity, when it comes to a farm, will secure the finances of that farm for generations.&quot;</p> <p>Chris Lacey, 62, whose family owns 80 acres of land on the Marcellus Shale in Chenango, said: &quot;Life has risks. And yes, any industry has risks. But on the other hand, this community is dying, and we need the jobs.&quot;</p> <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental attorney whom Mr. Cuomo appointed during his first year in office to an advisory panel on fracking, countered, &quot;I think he's taking an intelligent approach, which is to wait and see.&quot; Mr. Kennedy added, &quot;Everybody else has jumped in and said, 'Let's get our share,' and he's saying, 'Wait a second, this isn't going to go away.' &quot;</p> <p>&mdash;Daniel Gilbert and Jessica Bakeman contributed to this article.</p> <p> <strong>Write to </strong> Erica Orden at <a href="mailto:erica.orden@wsj.com" target="_new" class="icon " >erica.orden@wsj.com</a> </p>
